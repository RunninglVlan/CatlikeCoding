[Game Objects and Scripts - Creating a Clock](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/game-objects-and-scripts/)

## What's new
- Rotate objects around temporary hierarchy objects: reset rotation of the object you want to rotate around a point, then add it to temporary object, rotate it, e.g., by 30 degrees, then move your object outside of temporary and Unity will set the position and rotation of your object to correct values
